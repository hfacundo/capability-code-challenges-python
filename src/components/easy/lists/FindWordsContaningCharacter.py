# Find Words Containing Character.

# You are given a 0-indexed list of strings words and a character x.

# Return a list of indices representing the words that contain the character x.

# Note that the returned list may be in any order.

# Example 1:
#     Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
#     Output: [0,1]
#     Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.

# Example 2:
#     Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
#     Output: [0,2]
#     Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.

# Example 3:
#     Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
#     Output: []
#     Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty list.

# Constraints:

#     * 1 <= words.length <= 50
#     * 1 <= words[i].length <= 50
#     * x is a lowercase English letter.
#     * words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
